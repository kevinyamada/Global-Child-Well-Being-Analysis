,DEFINITIONS OF THE INDICATORS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Population (thousands) – Total population,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Annual population growth rate – Average exponential rate of growth of the population over one year. It is calculated as ln(Pt/P0)/T where P0 is the population at the beginning of the time period, Pt the population at the end of the time period, and  T the length of the period. It is expressed as a percentage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Annual number of births – Annual number of births for the reference year. Data are presented in thousands.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Total fertility – The average number of live births a hypothetical cohort of women would have at the end of their reproductive period if they were subject during their whole lives to the fertility rates of a given period and if they were not subject to mortality. It is expressed as live births per woman.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Dependency ratios – The total dependency ratio is the ratio of the sum of the population aged 0–14 and that aged 65+ to the population aged 15–64. The child dependency ratio is the ratio of the population aged 0–14 to the population aged 15–64. The old-age dependency ratio is the ratio of the population aged 65 years or over to the population aged 15–64. All ratios are presented as number of dependents per 100 persons of working age (15–64).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Life expectancy at birth – Number of years newborn children would live if subject to the mortality risks prevailing for the cross section of population at the time of their birth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Share of urban population – Urban population as a percentage of the total population.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Annual growth rate of urban population – Average annual exponential rate of growth of the urban population over a given period, expressed as a percentage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Net migration rate – The number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants over a period, divided by the person-years lived by the population of the receiving country over that period. It is expressed as net number of migrants per 1,000 population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
